# Project Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher).
- You have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js).
- You have installed [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) globally.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd /Users/harish/Cobay/cobayone/ci-cd/staging-client-side
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, use the following command:
